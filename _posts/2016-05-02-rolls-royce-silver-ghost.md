Rolls Royce Silver Ghost

I saw this cool car named Rolls Royce Silver ghost in a hotel in Cochin, a car designed by Henry Royce, the founder of Rolls Royce. With his design he wanted to replace his earlier rough-running six-cylinder car with something more reliable, smoother and quieter. He introduced it at the Olympia Motor Show in 1906\. The car was later named Silver Ghost, and became the longest-running single model next to the Model T Ford. It is the most famous luxury car in history. The car remains the most desirable model among pre-1930 cars.
